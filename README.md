Put this script in a folder with lots of .EXE/.DLL files and it will sort them into categories: NET / Native.
The script will search for binary files and categorize them.

Use hotkey {H} for getting help

Currently supports: **[VB NET, C#, JScript, Delphi] (NET)** | **[C++, C, VB4-6] (NATIVE)** and detects **UPX**
