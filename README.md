# ðŸ’¾ FindEXEC â€” the best sorting tool for software reversers

âœ¨ **This program will be useful if you have to reverse a huge amount of binary files.**

> During operation, a small error is allowed (non-standard NET assemblies may be incorrectly detected by the program)

Put this script in a folder with lots of .EXE/.DLL files and it will sort them into categories: NET (VB NET/C#/IL) / Native.
Once launched, the script will search the current folder for binary files and categorize them.
